          <p>
            Drug overdose is currently one of the leading causes of death in the United States, surpassing firearms, car accidents, homicides and AIDS. 
            More Americans died from a drug overdose in 2017 alone than died in the entire Vietnam War.
            <br><br>
            Most of these deaths are preventable, but the "tough on crime" rhetoric of the decades-long drug war and the stigma associated with drug use have blocked the widespread adoption of life-saving overdose prevention and treatment policies.

            Introduction: What is Overdose?</h2>
          <p>
            An overdose is a biological response to when the human body receives too much of a substance or mix of substances. An
            overdose can be intentional or accidental. People can overdose on illicit drugs, alcohol, prescription medications, and
            many other substances. The video below introduces what happens when you overdose.

                <strong>In this project, we are going to investigate the VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts dataset</strong> to have a peek at the trend of drug overdoses across the Unites States and potentially inform national institutions of best practices and policies. The dataset reports provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally grouped by different drug classes from 2015 to 2018.
                <br><br>
                In addition to an exploration into the drug overdose death counts, we are also curious regarding what factors are correlated or influential on these count numbers. And therefore, <strong>for each state we also gathered their <i>household incomes, unemployment rates, crime rates</i> and <i>population</i> over the years</strong>, seeking potential relationships between demographics, social structures and drug overdoses.

              As can be seen from the figure above, <strong>the middle U.S. generally enjoys the lowest drug overdose death rate across the nation over the years</strong>, followed by western U.S. where drug overdose has become a non-negligible social issue. <strong>Eastern U.S. has the most complicated distribution</strong> --- West Virginia has always got the first place in terms of drug overdose from 2015 to 2018, and the neighboring states also seem to be affected and have noticeably higher overdose death rates than those further from West Virginia.
            <br><br>
              By selecting different types of drug overdose, we observe that <b> overdoses of cocaine and opioids are mostly happening in the eastern U.S.</b>, particularly including West Virginia, Ohio and Rhode island doing cocaine, and also their neighboring states (e.g. Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire) doing opioids. Heroin and methadone overdoses are more or less distributed in both the western and the eastern U.S. <b>Psychostimulant overdoses, however, are much more dominated in the western U.S.</b>, including Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, etc. Washington has seen a decrease in their psychostimulant overdose, while the others have seen increases along with rapidly increasing West Virginia over the years.

              The above graph visualizes the overall death rate and individual death rates of 5 different drug types in each state. The five drug types include Cocaine, Opioids, Heroin, Methadone and Psychostimulants.
              As some of the states do not have the overdose death data for certain the drug types, the number of lines of a particular state may be fewer than 6, and its curves may be shorter than others as well.
            <br><br>
              The above graph shows increasing trends in overall overdose death in most of the states from 2015 to 2018. 
              <b>Some states, such as California, show a rapid increase in overall death rate.</b> However, some other states, such as Washington and Utah, remain stable or show a slight decrease in the death rate.
              Among the five drugs: Cocaine, Opioids, Heroin, Methadone and Psychostimulants, <b>Opioids contribute the most overdose deaths</b>, whose death rate is nearly the sum of the death rates of the other drug types.

                <h3> Household income</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Question: Is household income of a state related to its overdose death rate?</b>
                    <br>
                  <br>
                    In the bubble chart, we aim to show the correlation between household income and overdose death rate. The size of each bubble indicates the population of the state. As we can see from the plot, <b>there is no clear correlation between overdose death rate and median household income.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    However, we can see that overdose death rate of the states with lower household income tend to increase faster than
                    other states. For example, we can see that West Virginia has comparatively low income improvement but very rapid
                    overdose death rate increase. On the other hand, the median income of Florida increases rapidly and its overdose death
                    rate remains at the same level during these 5 years.
                    <b>Therefore, we suspect that there might be negative correlation between overdose death growth rate and median household income growth rate.</b> This could be a further research hypothesis to test on.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Unemployment Rate</h3>
                <p>
                
                  <b>Question: Is unemployment rate of a state related to its overdose death rate?</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Now let's take a look at how drug overdose and unemployment is related. To achieve this, we make a bubble plot of death
                  rate and unemployment rate. As we can see from the interactive figure, <b> the drug overdose death rate and unemployment rate are basically positively correlated. </b> 
                  This means the more people are unemployed, the more likely the overdose death rate is higher. The size of
                  this correlation should be determined quantitatively and its changing trend is also interesting to investigate.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <b>Note, however, this does not imply causality.</b> In general, the unemployment rate has been decreasing over time, while for
                  some states the death rate even goes higher and higher. Why could this happen? It is a sociology question that needs to
                  be carefully considered.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Violent Crime Rate</h3>
                <p>
                
                  <b>Question: Is violent crime rate of a state related to its overdose death rate?</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  We might anticipate a correlation between the overdose death rate and the violent crime rate as the overdose is likely to cause violent crime according to the news. <b>According to the figure, the violent crime amount and overdose death number have relatively positive correlation as we expected.</b> But there are also some exceptions. For instance West Virginia has the highest age-adjusted rate of drug
                  overdose deaths involving opioids (see <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/opioid-summaries-by-state/west-virginia-opioid-summary">here</a>), but the crime rate is relatively low.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Also, the situation is getting better in 2016 compared with 2015, overdose rate in most of the states has dropped as
                  well as the crime rate. However, after 2016, a sudden turn for the worse occurs. As for crime rate, some states show a
                  decreasing trend, such as VA, NJ and CT. The common feature these states have is their low crime rate. In contrast, the
                  cities with higher crime rate like CA, TN, MO have their crime rate increased.

              To estimate the overdose level of an arbitrary state, we first formulated four levels of
              overdose danger based on the quartiles of the current death rates across all the states
              in the U.S., labeled <b>Low, Medium, High and Extreme overdose </b> respectively. Taking advantage of the
              social demographical features including household income, unemployment rate and crime rate,
              <b>a decision tree classifier </b>is trained to predict how a state with given attributes might
              suffer from drug overdose. The classifier is presented through the
              interactions below.

            <h3>Is the data Complete?</h3>
            <b>Data collection</b>
            <br><br>
            We started with <a href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/vsrr-provisional-drug-overdose-death-counts">VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts</a> dataset to have a peek at the trend of drug overdoses across the Unites States. The dataset reports provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction for every 12 month-ending period (from January 2015 to April 2019) grouped by drug classes.
            <br><br>
            To explore the relationship between drug overdose and other social factors, we set out to collect complementary data sources for each state and each year from 2015 to 2019.

            The first source is median household incomes retrieved from US Census Bureau. The table includes the median income of households in each state from 2013 to 2019.

            The second source is unemployment rate, retrieved from Local Area Unemployment Statistics. The table includes raw unemployment rate and number of labor force by each state and each month from January 2015 to September 2019.

            The third source is crime rate, retrieved from FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services. The table includes population, crime number and crime rate for each state from 2014 to 2018.

            With all these data at hand, we can start to explore the data and the underlying social problems.
            <br><br>

            <b>Dropped columns and missing values</b>
            <br><br>
            The <i>Period</i> column always takes the value "12 month-ending", so it brings us no benefit to keep this column. The <i>Footnote</i> and <i>Footnote Symbol</i> columns are only text comments that are not useful for our analysis and will be discarded.
            <br><br>
            Regarding the <i>Percent Pending Investigation</i> column, according to the dataset description, "drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death “pending investigation”. Jurisdictions are included if 1% or fewer of their records in National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) are reported as “pending investigation.”
            <br><br>
            Regarding the <i>Percent Complete</i> column, "NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdiction. The completeness is the percentage of the number of death records in the NVSS database over the received estimates. Jurisdictions are included if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods."
            <br><br>
            The dataset curator has already used some threshold in these columns to filter out some low quality numbers, so we won't make further use of these percent columns. The excluded numbers are presented as NaN in the table and will be discarded. 
            The <i>Predicted Value</i> column is dedicated to compensating for long temporal delays and the incompleteness of reported deaths. Some of the predictions, however, are missing, so we will fill these numbers with the actual available <i>Data Value</i> column and drop the rest.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Is the data Coherent?</h3>
            Note that some sources only provide data on a yearly basis, but others on a monthly basis. Therefore we need to take good care of this. When dealing with monthly data, we should divide the death count by 12 as a moving average over the 12-month period. When dealing with yearly data, we might want to only take the count that collected in December.
            <br><br>
            There are some other data issues in the original dataset. All but three indicators are specific drugs or drug classes, and the three non-drug indicators are <i>Number of Drug Overdose Deaths</i>, <i>Number of Deaths</i> and <i>Percent with drugs specified</i>. In the <i>State Names</i> column, it can take the value of <i>District of Columbia</i>, <i>United States</i> and <i>New York City</i>, none of which are actually states and will be removed.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Is the data Correct?</h3>
            The data might exhibit bias due to the uncertainty of the data collection process and the time lag of the drug overdose statistics. Part of this problem is addressed by the <i>Predicted Value</i> column in the original dataset, but some of the other datasets might not have their data adjusted according to season or other variations. Therefore, there could be implicit bias that we are not able to detect or directly address.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Is the data aCcountable?</h3>
            The original drug overdose death dataset is downloaded from <a href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/vsrr-provisional-drug-overdose-death-counts">VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts</a>.
            Complementary datasets are collected from different platforms. For median household incomes, the data is retrieved from <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html">US Census Bureau: Income and Poverty in the United States</a>. For unemployment rate, the data is retrieved from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/lau/" >Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a>. For crime rate, the data is retrieved from <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018">FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services</a>. All data we collected are accessible to the public and a cleaned version that joins all of them is available at <a href="https://github.com/niwatorrri/niwatorrri.github.io/tree/master/Overdose/data"> our repository</a>.
