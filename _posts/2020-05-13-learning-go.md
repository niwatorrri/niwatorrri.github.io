## Why Go?

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language. It was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases. The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics.

Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. More of the features:

- Minimalism: easy to learn, read, write and maintain
- Compatibility: succinct and strict compatibility guarantees
- Performance: compiled language similar to C, optimized standard libraries, built-in concurrency primitives (lower latency and smaller overhead)
- Development: auto documentation, embedded test environment, race condition detector, etc.
- OOP without classes, inheritance, constructors, generics, and others
