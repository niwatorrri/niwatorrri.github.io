I'll elaborate my thoughts on the following aspects of the game Celeste if I have time:

1. Controls: smoother than ever

2. How new mechanisms are introduced

3. Level design and embodied cognition

4. How it encourages players: minimal death cost, collectibles, A/B/C sides, assist mode

5. Plot: a gentle yet deep touch on depression

6. Music: vibe, immersion and hidden details
