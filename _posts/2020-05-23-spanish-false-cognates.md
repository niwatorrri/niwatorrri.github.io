Spanish and English have a lot of words that look very similar and share the same meaning. For example,

> el restaurante = restaurant
>
> maravilloso = marvelous
>
> decidir = to decide

However, there are some *false cognates*, which look quite similar but actually have totally different meanings in Spanish and English. One needs to be extra cautious with these words. Here are some of them:
